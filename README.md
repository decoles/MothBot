# MothBot
Open Source Python Bot that shows how to use tensorflow, message responses, sounds, and Youtube audio streaming.

## Running Locally
After cloning repository to your machine:
1. Create a .env file and add a TOKEN variable with your bots token.
2. Create a local sounds folder and add any sounds you want. I've used ```.mp3``` & ```.wav```. It has to be called ```sounds```
2. Run it with ```python3 main.py```
